# Part 5

# Discussion 1
Q: What would be a really simple solution if n were not an argument, i.e., if it were always 17?

A: Instead of asking for an integer (n) we could run the loop 17 times. 

#Discussion 2
Q:  How could you have automatically tested your initial solution from part 2?

A: First, not asking the user for a number, and then replacing the "int n" on line 32 with a 17 and running the program.

#Discussion 3

Q: What changes between parts 2, 3, and 4, and what stays the same? Does it matter what list implementation you choose? If so, in what way(s)?

A: The loop to add the elements to the list stays the same but the array method is no longer needed for the implementation. 
    You need to use an arraylist instead because it makes it easier to add the elements in the loop and you can add as many as you want
